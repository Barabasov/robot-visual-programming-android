The development of robotics have a great potential
to be integrated with educational system. Robotics
become more common in elementary and high school
students. However, the absence of a module which
integrates hardware and software makes harder for them
to learn robotic. To help students learning robotics by
using an easy to build robot with a dedicated interactive
Graphical User Interface (GUI) to program it, we
propose a module that integrates the simplicity of
modular robot with feasible and appealing mobile visual
IDE programming apps. A modular robot which allows
student to build the robot without have to build it from
the scratch, and Mobile visual IDE is an android based
apps which allow user to program robot in GUI with a
drag and drop icons followed by property editor. The
icons represent robot commands such as moving and
interacting with objects. This module also support
advanced robotics features such as line follower, wall
follower and free movement.
